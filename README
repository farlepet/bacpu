BACPU -- Peter Farley

    BACPU is a project oriented at creating a well-documented CPU that
can be easily be simulated on top of today's CPU's. It is a 32-bit CPU
with a small instruction set and able to handle up to 256 peripheral
devices.

    NOTE: The documentation is in a constant state of change, so some
information you may have seen earlier, may be changed, or completly 
removed. If you really plan on using this project, wait until this note
has been removed. You have been warned.
