Desctiption of BACPU interrupts
-------------------------------

	The interrupt vectors for the BACPU are in the first * bytes of memory.


*** Interrupt vector format ***

+--------------+
| Pointer (4B) +-------------+
| Region (4B)  | Offset (2B) |
+--------------+-------------+
	There are two pointers, the second one is not zero only is there is a
	different version of the interrupt for planar memory mode.
