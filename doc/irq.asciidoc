How to call an IRQ
------------------

If a peripheral wants to call an IRQ, it must bring it's IRQ line high. Once
it does that, the CPU will be notified (For schematic, see peripheral.txt) Once
the CPU has time to take care of the IRQ, it will call the interrupt vector, and
jump into the code. The code must tell the peripheral to drop the line low
again, or the CPU will be stuck in an interrupt-loop.
