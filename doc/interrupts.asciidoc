Every interrupt vector is 4 bytes. They consist of only a pointer to the
interrupt routine.

Interrupt Calling
-----------------
When an interrupt is to be executed, the interrupt controller brings an internal
"wait" line high, and when the CPU brings it's "allow" line high, the interrupt
gets called, right after both lines are brought back low.
