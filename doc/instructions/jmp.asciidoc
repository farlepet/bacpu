[width="33%",cols="^1,^2,3"]
|===================================================
| Short (1 bit) | Backwards (1 bit) | Planar (1 bit)
|===================================================

Short:
[start=0]
	. Long Jump
	. Short Jump

Backwards:
[start=0]
	. Short Jump is Forwards
	. Short Jump is Backwards

Planar:
[start=0]
	. Jump is to Linear memory
	. Jump is to Planar memory


Instruction Flow
----------------
[options="compact"]
    * Check Planar bit
    ** Planar == 0
    *** Check first register is valid
    **** False
    ***** Increase PC
    ***** Call exception
    *** Check Short bit
    **** Short == 0
    ***** Check that the register value does not exceed that
            amount of available memory
    . False
    .. Increase PC
    .. Call exception
    . True
    .. Set PC to register
    **** Short == 1
    ***** Check Backwards bit
    . Backwards == 0
    .. Add value to PC
    . Backwards == 1
    .. Subtract value from PC
    ***** Check that current PC value is within range
    . False
    .. Call exception (irrecoverable)
    ** Planar == 1
    *** Check if both registers are valid
    **** False
    ***** Increase PC
    ***** Call exception
    *** Check Short bit
    **** Short == 0
    ***** Check that plane exists
    . False
    .. Increase PC
    .. Call exception
    . True
    .. Set CR to first register
    .. Set PC to second register
    **** Sort == 1
    ***** Check Backwards bit
    . Backwards == 0
    .. Add first register to CR
    .. Add second register to PC
    . Backwards == 1
    .. Subtract second register from CR
    .. Subtract second register from PC
    ***** Check that plane CR exists
    . False
    .. Call exception (irrecoverable)


Instruction Format
------------------
    * If Planar == 0
    ** OpCode with two registers
	*** First Register:     Pointer to location to jump to
	*** Second Register:    Unused
    * Else If Planar == 1
	** Instruction Format: OpCode with two registers
	*** First Register:     Plane to jump to
	*** Second Register:    Offest within the plane to jump to
