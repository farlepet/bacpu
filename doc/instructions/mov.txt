MOV instruction
---------------

	The MOV instruction moves data from one place to another. It can handle
3 sizes, BYTE, WORD, DWORD.


*** Instruction Info layout ***

	   4	   3	  		  2		  1		  0
+--------------+--------------+---------------+
| Src (2 bits) | Dest (1 bit) | Size (2 bits) |
+--------------+--------------+---------------+

Size:
 0) BYTE
 1) WORD
 2) DWORD
 3) N/A

DEST:
 0) Register
 1) Memory

SRC:
 0) Register
 1) Memory
 2) Immediate
 3) N/A

	SRC and DEST cannot both be Memory, if this occurs, an exception will
be triggered. If interrupts are not properly setup, this could cause the CPU to
restart, so it would be wise to be careful not to do this.


*** Instruction Format ***

If DEST == 0
	If SRC == 0
		Instruction Format: OpCode with two registers
		First Register:     Source
		Second Register:    Destination
	Else If SRC == 1
		Instruction Format: OpCode with Immediate and Register
		Immediate:          Pointer to Source in Memory
		Register:           Destination
	Else If SER == 2
		Instruction Format: OpCode with Immediate and Register
		Immediate:			Source value
		Register:			Destination
Else If DEST == 1
	If SRC == 0
		Instruction Format: OpCode with Immediate and Register
		Immediate:          Pointer to Destination in Memory
		Register:			Source:
	If SRC == 1
		Invalid Opcode. Do not use.
	If SRC == 2
		Instruction Format: Opcode with two Immediates
		First Immediate:    Source Value
		Second Immediate:   Pointer to Destination in Memory
