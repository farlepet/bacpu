*** Instruction Flow ***

INT
    * Check Src bit
        * Src == 0
            * Check that register is valid AND in range
                * False
                    * Increase IP
                    * Call exception
                * True
                    * Call interrupt based on register value
                    * Increase IP
        * Src == 1
            * Check that immediate is within range
                * False
                    * Increase IP
                    * Call exception
                * True
                    * Call interrupt based on immediate value
                    * Increase IP


*** Instruction Format ***

If Src == 0
	Instruction Format: OpCode with two registers
	First Register:     Interrupt
	Second Register:    Unused
Else
	Instruction Format: OpCode and Immediate 
	Immediate:          Interrupt
