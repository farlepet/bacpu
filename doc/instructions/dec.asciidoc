DEC instruction
===============
The DEC instruction decrements a register. It is exactly the same is the INC
instruction except it decrements instead of increments.

Instruction Flow
----------------
    * Check that first register is valid
    ** False
    *** Increase PC
    *** Call exception
    * Set ALU to subtraction
    * Set second ALU input to 1
    * Subtract
    * Set Flags
    ** ALU carry == 1 -> Flags.Carry
    * Set register to result
    * Increase PC


Instruction Format
------------------
    * OpCode with two registers
	* First Register:   Register to decrement
	* Second Register:  Unused
