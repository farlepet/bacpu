Instruction Flow
----------------
    * Check Src bit
    ** Src == 0
    *** Check that register is valid AND in range
    **** False
    ***** Increase IP
    ***** Call exception
    *** Call interrupt/exception based on register value
    *** Increase IP
    ** Src == 1
    *** Check that immediate is within range
    **** False
    ***** Increase IP
    ***** Call exception
    *** Call interrupt/exception based on immediate value
    *** Increase IP


Instruction Format
------------------
    * Src == 0
	** OpCode with two registers
	*** First Register:  Interrupt
	*** Second Register: Unused
    * Else If Src == 1
	** OpCode and Immediate 
	*** Immediate: Interrupt
