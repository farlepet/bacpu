CPI instruction
===============

	The CPI instruction is used to gather various information about the CPU and
closely connected parts.

Instruction Flow
----------------
    * Check that both registers are valid
    ** False
    *** Increase PC
    *** Call exception
    * Check value of first register
    ** Invalid Value
    *** Increase PC
    *** Call exception
    * Write value of internal CPU register to second register
    * Increase PC


Instruction Format
------------------
    * OpCode with two registers
	** First Register:  Info Slot
	** Second Register: Which register to store info into


CPU information slots
---------------------
[start=0]
	. Attached memory
		* In bytes
	. Attached devices
		* Number of `COMM` accessible devices
		* There may be gaps between devices, so you still must search all slots
			until you reach this number.
		* There is a maximum of 256. If there are 256 devices, there will be NO
			gaps.
	. Manufacturer code
		* A 32-bit number used by the manufacturer/creator
		** See codes.txt for more information
	. Version number
		* The current version of the CPU
		** Meaning is dependant on the manufacturer
	. Capabilities
		* A bit string representing the BACPU's capabilities
		** NOTE: This could also be derived from the Manufacture code and the
				Version number, but that would be memory and time consuming.
		* Some bits may be manufacturer-dependant, if it is not displayed in
			this document.
		* Layout of the bit string (0 == LSB):
	    ** 0 - Planar Memory
		*** Whether or not the BACPU supports the Planar Memory layout
